Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

A text-based game that takes the user trough a labyrinth. Built with React Redux using Thunks to fetch the API wich stores the game information and tracks the user history. Created during mob-programming.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We started with setting up our reducers in React Redux with the help of Redux Toolkit. With this set we started to create our components and to fetch data from the game API via a Thunk. Getting the basic functionality to work, which was to show only in text where the user was and what options they had at the current time.
We decided to try out Material UI for the styling, with styled components as a complementary tool.
